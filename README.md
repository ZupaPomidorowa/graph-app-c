# Graph app
* The goal of project is to write a program that:
* Generate a graph with a given number of columns and rows of nodes and edge weights drawn in a given range of values.
* Save such a graph to a file
* Can read a graph from a file
* Can check if given graph is connected (breadth-first graph search algorithm - BFS)
* Can find the shortest paths between selected pairs of nodes in this graph using Dijkstra's Algorithm
